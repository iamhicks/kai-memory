## What We Did

### MIND Agent System Fixes
- Fixed model selection bug (frontend wasn't sending user's chosen model to backend)
- Restored full SOUL prompts for all 4 agents (Architect, Builder, Storyteller, Steward)
- Added anti-hallucination constraints to prevent agents from making up scenarios
- Enabled Brainstorm Mode (moderated panel) for true multi-agent collaboration

### Documentation Created
- **MIND Technical Specification.md** - Complete technical specification covering:
  - Mission Statement ("The team you can't afford and the co-founder you haven't found")
  - 4 agents with domain-agnostic expertise (not just tech)
  - 3 conversation modes (single, brainstorm, collaborative)
  - Architecture, data models, UI design
  - Development roadmap

### Key Decisions
- Agents are NOT locked into tech - they adapt to any domain (coffee shops, creative agencies, etc.)
- Brainstorm mode allows all 4 agents to respond together in roundtable format
- War Room UI is the main chat interface (right panel removed per agreement)
- Mission: "Stop building alone" - addressing founder isolation

### Still Open
- Agents don't actually invoke each other yet (just mention @name)
- Shared memory between agents needs implementation
- Agent handoffs need orchestration system

## Next Steps
- Implement true agent collaboration (shared context, handoffs)
- Test brainstorm mode with all 4 agents responding
- Create action extraction from agent conversations to tasks/projects

## Reflection
- Spent 3+ hours debugging model selection - root cause was two separate JS classes not sharing data
- Technical spec now serves as single source of truth
- Mission statement captures the emotional core: founder isolation
