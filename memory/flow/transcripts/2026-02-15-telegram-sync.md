telegram messages need to be chat as we had yesterday. get this working again as we had yesterday, all messenger messages go into flowchat. when I send you a meesage from telegram I use /marketing or /dev for example to send to your different roles in flowchat if i do not use a "/" then it goes to General channel. what does clawvault acutally show when fully populated?

Replies work like this:

1. You send: /code How do I fix this?
2. It appears in FLOW Code channel
3. I reply (in Telegram) AND post to FLOW
4. My reply appears in Code channel too

So you see the full conversation in FLOW.

✅ Reply forwarding is now active.

Every time I reply to you in Telegram, I will also post the same reply to FLOW. This keeps the full conversation history in both places.

Test it: Switch to Code channel in FLOW, then send me /code Hello from Telegram.
