   - macOS app bundle generation

2. **Full documentation**
   - README.md with features, install, architecture
   - ADVISOR_SYSTEM_README.md for detailed guide

3. **Synced dev → production**
   - Archived old stable to `mind-stable/20-02-2026/`
   - Replaced with new web+server architecture
   - 976 files changed, 67k+ insertions

4. **Git push to GitHub**
   - ✅ Removed large files (node_modules, backups) using git filter-branch
   - ✅ Added .gitignore
   - ✅ Commit: "🚀 MIND v1.0 Complete Release"
   - ✅ Push successful after removing Electron from history

5. **Fixed agent response issues**
   - Simplified SOUL_PROMPTs for all 4 agents (was too verbose, causing echo)
   - Changed engine from generate() to chat() API for proper system/user separation
   - Fixed Architect, Builder, Storyteller, Steward prompts
   - Prompts now ultra-simple: "You are The [Name], a helpful [type] advisor..."

### Next Steps
- Test fresh install on clean machine
- Create release tag
- Update landing page with install instructions

## 🌙 Evening Session: Revenue Exploration

### Key Discoveries

1. **Web search now working** - Brave API configured successfully

2. **Agent Packs Market Validated**
   - ClawTeam: $19/pack (competitor to MIND PM features)
   - AgentPacks.ai: $18-22/pack, $64/mo subscription
   - ClawController: Kanban dashboard for OpenClaw agents
   - Agent Orchestrator: 40K lines, 30 parallel agents, sophisticated system

3. **Larry Skill (TikTok marketing)**
   - Oliver Henry's agent got 8M views in one week
   - Automates TikTok slideshow creation
   - Requires Postiz ($29/mo) for auto-posting
   - Can post manually for free

4. **Revenue Ideas Explored**
   - OpenClaw setup service (rejected - too much support)
   - Trading products (rejected - saturated, Pete not expert)
   - AI copywriting/service (requires ongoing work)
   - PDF products (passive, low price)

5. **MIND Direction Decision Pending**
   - ClawController covers project management well
   - Agent Orchestrator covers parallel agent work
   - **Pivot idea:** Focus MIND on notes/knowledge/long-term memory
   - Pete reading AI Manifesto for inspiration on knowledge/memory systems

### Current State
- Agent chat working in MIND
- Ollama connected (7 models available)
- Can research competitors and market
- Pete considering: notes + knowledge + memory as MIND differentiator

### Blocker
- Cannot find revenue model that:
  - Doesn't require Pete's ongoing work
  - Doesn't need video/audio creation
  - Doesn't need tech support
  - Can make $50/day quickly

**Next:** Waiting for Pete to finish reading AI Manifesto and decide on MIND direction
