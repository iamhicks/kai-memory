# Session Summary

**Date:** 16-02-2026  
**Duration:** ~10 hours  
**Focus:** MIND app bug fixes and improvements  
**Outcome:** Success

---

## Key Accomplishments
### ✅ Completed
- **Unified Search** — Cmd+K now searches both current notes AND ClawVault backup
- **Fixed Dropdown Positioning** — Folder/note dropdowns now appear above note page using `position: fixed` with dynamic JavaScript positioning
- **Removed White Rectangle Outline** — Fixed folder hover visual bug
- **Fixed Rename Functionality** — Replaced broken `prompt()` with custom modal for Electron compatibility
- **Removed Clipped Pages Section** — Simplified to regular note clipping
- **Fixed Note Menu Width** — Compact dropdown instead of full-width
- **MIND Dev Workflow** — Set up proper folder structure matching FLOW (mind-dev/, mind-stable/, mind-live/)
- **Created Stable Backups** — mind-stable/16-02-26/1808 and mind-stable/16-02-26/1855

### ⚠️ Issues Encountered
- **Dropdowns appearing behind note page** — Fixed by using `position: fixed` and calculating screen coordinates via JavaScript
- **Electron prompt() not supported** — Fixed by creating custom rename modal
- **Dev process confusion** — Clarified and documented proper workflow

### 🚫 Blocked/Deferred
- None — all issues resolved

---

## Technical Decisions
1. **Use `position: fixed` for dropdowns** — Required to break out of sidebar stacking context and appear above main content
2. **JavaScript-based positioning** — Calculate `getBoundingClientRect()` to position dropdowns relative to clicked button
3. **Custom modal instead of prompt()** — Electron doesn't support native prompt(), built HTML modal with event listeners
4. **Unified search architecture** — Search both MIND notes and ClawVault in single query, no AI involvement for basic search

---

## Current State
- **Status:** Working, stable backups created
- **Location:** ~/Documents/Kai/Repos/mind-dev/ (active), mind-stable/16-02-26/1855/ (stable)
- **Backups:** mind-stable/16-02-26/1541 (original), 1808 (dropdown fixes), 1855 (rename + all fixes)

---

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for any remaining UI issues
2. Consider adding back clipped pages with better UX if requested
3. Future: Option A (OpenClaw integration for note search via Telegram)

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Electron prompt() is disabled by default** — always use custom modals
- **z-index stacking contexts are tricky** — `position: fixed` breaks out of parent contexts
- **Dev workflow needs to be explicit** — Pete needs clear folder structure matching FLOW
- **Test changes incrementally** — multiple small commits better than large batches
