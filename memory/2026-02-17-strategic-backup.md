# I am Hicks — Strategic Direction Backup
**Date:** 17 February 2026  
**Session Focus:** Brand positioning, product strategy, solo founder focus, personal story integration

---

## 🎯 Core Positioning: "Your Personal Advisory Board"

### The Shift
- **Old:** "Tools for Traders & Makers" (confused, multiple products)
- **New:** "Your Personal Advisory Board" (focused, single product)
- **Target:** Solo founders building businesses alone

### Why This Works
1. **Solves a real pain** — Founder isolation, decision paralysis, no one to bounce ideas off
2. **Justifies price** — $19/month vs $50K-500K/year for traditional advisory boards
3. **Differentiation** — Not "AI chatbot", not "note-taking app", but "advisory board"
4. **Emotional resonance** — "Stop building alone"

---

## 👤 Target Customer: Solo Founder

### Profile
- Building alone (no co-founder, no team)
- Making every decision themselves
- Wears 10 hats (strategy, code, marketing, sales, finance)
- Feels isolation at 3 AM when doubt strikes
- Can't afford $50K+ for real advisors
- Doesn't want to give away equity

### Pain Points (Website Copy)
1. **Decision Paralysis** — Analysis paralysis kills momentum
2. **Costly Mistakes** — Wrong pricing, positioning, features
3. **Founder Isolation** — No one to call at 3 AM
4. **Bad Advice Is Expensive** — Consultants $300+/hr, accelerators want 7%

### Solution
15 AI advisors available 24/7 for $19/month:
- Strategy, Code, Marketing, Sales, Product, Design
- Finance, Legal, Research, Writing, Operations
- Mindset, Entrepreneur, Debug, General

## 🧠 Brainstorm Mode (V3)

### Concept
Multi-advisor discussion where:
1. **Moderator** frames the question
2. **3-4 advisors** respond with their expertise
3. **Synthesis** provides clear recommendation
4. **Action plan** with next steps

### Example Flow
```
User: "Should I price at $19 or $29?"

Moderator: Frames discussion from strategic, financial, marketing angles

Strategy: "$19 positions for early-stage founders — our core market"

Finance: "At $19 vs $29, need 52% more customers. Volume matters now."

Marketing: "Grandfather early users, create urgency messaging"

Synthesis: "Launch at $19, plan increase to $29 at month 6"

Action Plan: Set price, create Founding Member tier, plan migration
```

### Features Added
- Live streaming (see each advisor respond in real-time)
- No advisor limit (was 4, now unlimited)
- 3-minute timeout for Ollama
- Save to new note / insert into current note / copy

## 👨‍💼 Pete's Personal Story (Brand Authenticity)

### Background
- **Location:** Wales (Cardigan area)
- **Family:** Wife, 4-year-old daughter (top priority)
- **Work:** Transitioning to full-time day trading after 5 years learning
- **Past:** Web dev, UI/UX design, failed SaaS startups
- **Passion:** Surfing/windsurfing (30 years)

### The Struggle (Relatable to Solo Founders)
- Not earning yet, financial stress
- Fear of loss (even $10) and FOMO
- Fatherhood distractions during trading hours
- Needs work-life balance
- Decision fatigue from wearing multiple hats

### Why This Product Exists
> "I built this because I needed it. Trading alone at 3 AM, no one to call when I wasn't sure whether to hold or cut. Building alone, no one to bounce ideas off. I wanted an advisory board but couldn't afford $50K/year or give away equity. So I built one that fits a solo founder's budget."

### Authenticity Points
- Built by a founder who actually uses it daily
- Understands the psychology of building alone
- Values privacy (data never leaves device)
- Values ownership (Markdown export, no lock-in)
- Realistic about constraints (time, money, energy)
