# Session: 17 February 2026 — Evening

## Accomplishments

### MIND App Fixes
- ✅ **Fixed Website Deployment**: Switched from Jekyll to GitHub Actions workflow, site now live at iamhicks.com with new messaging
- ✅ **Fixed Writing Role**: Updated embedded roles in index.html — was showing old "Senior Editorial Director" instead of "Solo Founder Writer"
- ✅ **Fixed Obsidian Roles**: Added missing roles 1-9 to AI-Roles-Complete.md (was only showing 10-16)
- ✅ **Fixed Brainstorm Mode**: Changed `addAIChatMessage` to `renderChatMessage` in moderated-panel.js
- ✅ **Fixed Help Folder First Startup**: Moved logic from initTemplates() (scope issues) to loadData() where it properly creates and selects Help folder
- ✅ **Expanded Data Management Help**: Added comprehensive documentation about backups, trash, exports, and Notion/Obsidian imports

### Documentation & Process
- ✅ Added bug tracking workflow to AGENTS.md — now include checklist at end of every reply
- ✅ Created brand naming brief for agency engagement
- ✅ Created expanded Brand advisor role (16th advisor)
- ✅ All 16 AI roles now fully expanded and in both MIND and Obsidian

### Strategic Decisions
- Website positioning: "Your Personal Advisory Board" for solo founders
- Pricing: $49 one-time (not subscription)
- Domain: Keeping iamhicks.com for now
- Name exploration: HicksLab vs AskHicks vs other options — tabled for agency input

## Blockers
- None active — all reported bugs have fixes pending user verification

## Next Steps
- User to test MIND clean install and verify Help folder shows on first startup
- User to test Brainstorm Mode functionality
- User to test all 16 advisors are working
- Wait for naming agency feedback
- Plan Telegram integration (Phase 1: desktop-dependent)

## Reflection

**What worked:**
- Systematic bug tracking with checklist at end of replies
- Breaking down the Help folder issue by tracing code flow
- Using sub-agents for parallel tasks (role expansion, markdown conversion)

**What didn't:**
- Initial assumption about where Help folder logic should live (initTemplates vs loadData)
- Not catching the embedded roles vs ai-roles-complete.js distinction earlier
- GitHub Pages caching issues took too long to diagnose (was build failures, not cache)

## Key Files Changed
- `mind-dev/app/index.html` — Embedded roles, Help documentation, startup logic
- `mind-dev/app/js/moderated-panel.js` — Fixed method name
- `mind-dev/.github/workflows/pages.yml` — Created for deployment
- `workspace/AGENTS.md` — Added bug tracking workflow
- `workspace/ai-role-brand-proposal.md` — New Brand advisor role
- `Kai_Obsidian/Kai/Business/Synapse/AI-Roles-Complete.md` — All 16 roles

## Git Commits
- Multiple commits to mind-dev for bug fixes
- Website deployment workflow setup
- AGENTS.md workflow update
