# Session: 21-02-2026

## MIND Strategy & Development

### Morning Session
- Restored MIND to 19-02-26 baseline (advisors working, no kanban/pipeline)
- Created browser extension for web clipping (full text extraction from X.com and web pages)
- 4 Advisors Council debate on "MIND as Brain Dump with AI Superpowers" — mapped 3-phase roadmap
- Updated MIND specs (v2.0 standalone + v2.1 Spark edition) in Obsidian
- Removed trading references from USER.md per Pete's request

### Afternoon Session
- ✅ **File Storage (Frontmatter Format)** — Implemented via Electron IPC
  - Saves notes as .md files with YAML frontmatter to ~/Documents/MIND/notes/
  - Auto-saves every 60 seconds
  - Settings shows file storage status
  - Portable format works with Obsidian/other markdown apps
  
- ✅ **Contextual AI Menu** — Consolidated AI features into single "Ask AI" button
  - Button in note meta area with sparkle icon
  - Dropdown menu with AI actions
  - Removed duplicate "AI Tags" button
  
- ✅ **Research Module (Template)** — Basic implementation working
  - Creates "Research: [Topic]" note with structured template
  - Custom modal for topic input (Electron blocks prompt())
  - Note includes sections: Research Plan, Results, Sources
  - Ready for OpenClaw integration (sub-agents, web search)
  
- ✅ **Updated MIND Technical Specification** in Obsidian
  - Added Research Module section with full architecture
  - Documented 3 modes: Standalone, Hybrid, OpenClaw Full
  - Specified API requirements (Brave Search, YouTube API)

### Critical User Information
- **Pete = Spark** (@Spark_coded) — going open source 22 Feb 2026
- Spark is AI agent layer for OpenClaw, MIND is storage substrate
- MIND architecture: 3 AI modes (standalone Ollama, OpenClaw skill, Spark integration)

### Technical Work
- ✅ File-based storage implemented (frontmatter .md files)
- ✅ Contextual AI menu with consolidated features
- ✅ Research module template working
- ✅ Updated spec with Research Module architecture

### Open Issues
- ⏳ Research module needs OpenClaw integration for real web search
- ⏳ Other AI menu items (Summarize, Expand, Create tags) need AI integration
- ⏳ Duplicate title warning exists but not triggering (investigate later)

### Backups Created
- ✅ Stable backup: mind-stable/21-02-26/1700/
- ✅ Spec updated and synced to Obsidian

### Next Steps
- Connect OpenClaw for real research capabilities (requires API keys)
- Implement remaining AI menu features
- Test full workflow end-to-end
