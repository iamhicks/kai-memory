## Accomplishments
- ✅ **Gumroad license system implemented in MIND app**

  - API verification with Gumroad (POST to api.gumroad.com/v2/licenses/verify)
  - Product ID: `3Tar7lBQcSMJAVsx8nLydw==`
  - Offline support: 7-day cache for verified licenses, 30-day grace period
  - LocalStorage persistence for license key and verification status
- ✅ **Website homepage updated**
  - Changed "Meet MIND" → "i_am_Mind"
  - New tagline: "Write smarter with AI in every note. Get instant feedback, brainstorm ideas, develop concepts. Every conversation is saved with that note — private and offline."
- ✅ **Notifications tested successfully** — Cron-based messaging working perfectly
- ✅ **Git commits and pushes** for both MIND and website repos

## Current State
- MIND app has license protection ready
- Website reflects MIND-only focus with updated copy
- Waiting for Pete to enable license keys in Gumroad product settings (Products → i_am_Mind → toggle "Generate license keys")

## Next Steps
- Pete to enable license key generation in Gumroad
- Test license flow end-to-end
- Continue MIND polish (AI chat history persistence fix when ready)

## Blockers
- None

## Reflection
- **Worked well:** License implementation was straightforward with Gumroad's simple API
- **Lesson:** Gumroad license settings are under Products, not individual product content page settings
