## Session Metadata
**Date:** 13-02-2026  
**Duration:** ~3 hours  
**Focus:** FLOW instant messaging architecture research & SSE implementation  
**Outcome:** Success (SSE implemented, research complete)

---

## Key Accomplishments
### ✅ Completed
- Researched WebSocket vs SSE for FLOW instant messaging
- Created comprehensive research report in Obsidian
- Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) in FLOW server
- Added `/api/events-stream` endpoint to server.js
- Updated dashboard.html to use EventSource for real-time messages
- Reduced message display delay from 3s to ~500ms
- Committed changes: `caeac37`

### ⚠️ Issues Encountered
- Dashboard showed loading spinner — fixed by server restart
- User expected SSE to fix AI reply delay (60-90s) — clarified SSE only fixes display speed
- AI reply delay is architectural (webhook → heartbeat cycle)

### 🚫 Blocked/Deferred
- True instant AI replies — requires OpenClaw WebSocket proxy architecture (high complexity)
- User asked to research WebChat architecture before deciding on implementation

---

## Technical Decisions
1. **Use SSE instead of WebSocket** — Lower risk, no OpenClaw changes, sufficient for display speed
2. **Research OpenClaw WebChat architecture** — Found it uses direct Gateway WebSocket with `chat.send` method
3. **Defer WebChat-style implementation** — High complexity, decision pending user input

---

## Current State
- **Status:** Working (SSE active, messages display fast)
- **Location:** `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/flow/`
- **Server:** Running on port 3456 with SSE endpoint
- **Backups:** Git committed, stable tag available

---

## Next Steps
1. Await user decision on WebChat-style architecture implementation
2. If yes: Implement FLOW as WebSocket proxy to OpenClaw Gateway
3. If no: Current SSE is sufficient
4. Update documentation with final architecture decision

---

## Lessons Learned
- **SSE is simple and effective** for one-way server→client push
- **WebSocket is overkill** unless true bidirectional instant needed
- **AI reply delay is separate from display delay** — different architectural issues
- **OpenClaw WebChat uses `chat.send`** via Gateway WebSocket for instant responses
- **Always clarify scope** — user thought SSE would fix AI replies, but it only fixes display
