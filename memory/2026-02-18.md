## Critical Discoveries

### Memory Search Was Broken (Major)
- Discovered memory_search tool has been failing silently for unknown time
- Error: "No API key found for provider 'openai'"
- Pete rightfully concerned - this is a critical system failure
- Fixed by adding OpenAI API key to OpenClaw agent config
- **New rule:** Must alert Pete immediately if memory_search breaks again

### Bug Tracking Workflow Failures
- Repeatedly marked bugs as FIXED without Pete confirming
- Updated AGENTS.md with HARD RULES - only user can mark FIXED
- Created bug-tracker skill to enforce workflow
- Still struggling with habit of pre-tagging status

## MIND App Fixes Attempted

### Bugs Addressed:
1. Select Advisor button - modal now opens correctly
2. Single advisor reply - fixed role switching
3. Modal click-outside - now saves selection
4. Modal buttons - stacked vertically
5. Ollama status - shows actual connection state
6. "Synthesis" → "Summary" - changed in moderator prompt
7. Resize handle - moved outside hidden panel, made more visible
8. Multiple advisor meeting - debugging in progress
9. AI icon pulsing - code added
10. Save Meeting buttons - implemented

### Status: Pending Pete's testing confirmation

## New Ideas

### ClawVault Primitives (from Pedro's thread)
- Pedro building YAML-defined primitives (task, project, decision, lesson)
- Filesystem IS the integration - no database needed
- Obsidian as control plane with Kanban views
- Trigger-based autonomy vs cron-based
- This could solve MIND's bug tracking problem structurally

## Decisions Made

1. **Memory:** Alert immediately on memory_search failures - no silent fallback
2. **Bug tracking:** Never mark FIXED without explicit user confirmation
3. **Skills:** Created bug-tracker skill to enforce workflow
4. **MIND:** Continue with current fixes, consider ClawVault integration later

## Lessons

- Silent failures are worse than loud failures
- Pete needs to confirm fixes, not me assuming
- Structure > Willpower for enforcing behavior
- Pedro's primitive approach is the right architecture

## Blockers

- Multiple MIND bugs still need Pete's testing to confirm fixes work

## MAJOR PRODUCT PIVOT (18 Feb 2026)

### From "Smart Notes App" to "AI Accountability Partner"

**The realization:** MIND isn't a notes app with kanban. It's an AI-powered entrepreneurial operating system.

**User story:** Solo entrepreneurs who have ideas but can't get them to market because they lack:
- A co-founder
- A team holding them accountable
- Someone to call out their blocks

**MIND becomes:** "The team you can't afford and the co-founder you haven't found."

### Phases of User Journey:
1. **Chaos → Clarity** - Capture scattered ideas into one place
2. **Research → Knowledge** - AI advisors help learn and decide
3. **Knowledge → Action** - Projects track progress, AI holds accountable

### Key Features of New Direction:
- Morning standups with AI
- Weekly reviews analyzing progress patterns
- Blocker detection ("This has been 'in progress' for 14 days")
- Accountability nudges
- AI that acts like a team member, not a tool

### Architecture Decision:
**Standalone MIND:** "Good enough" with embedded LLM + file-based memory
- Functional RAG from notes/projects
- Basic advisor personas
- Pattern detection via weekly analysis

**MIND + OpenClaw:** "Full soul" upgrade path
- Rich personality (SOUL.md)
- Deep continuity (session history)
- Proactive reach-out (heartbeats)
- True relationship building

**Pitch:** "Give your advisors soul and personality - connect to OpenClaw"

### Competition:
Not Obsidian/Notion. Competes with:
- Business coaches ($500+/mo)
- Co-founder search
- Mastermind groups ($200+/mo)

### Why This Fits Pete:
"I've always had ideas but never got them to market. No team to support me."
MIND solves this exact pain.

## Next Steps

1. Refactor MIND positioning to "AI Accountability Partner"
2. Redesign Projects as core feature (not add-on)
3. Design standalone → OpenClaw upgrade path
4. Create marketing copy around "team you can't afford"
5. Keep fixing current MIND bugs in parallel
