# Session Summary - 2026-02-14

## Accomplishments
- ✅ Created clean STABLE backup of FLOW application at `app/Backups/STABLE-14-02-2026-1315/`
- ✅ Fixed backup issue - removed nested Backups folder from previous backup attempt
- ✅ Verified kanban workflow processes running (2 processes active)
- ✅ AUTO_PUSH running successfully - sessions backed up, no changes to push

## Key Decisions
- Backup should NOT include nested Backups folder (lesson learned)
- Use rsync with `--exclude='Backups'` to prevent recursive backup copies

## Current State
- FLOW server: Running on port 3456
- Kanban processes: 2 active (watcher + telegram bridge)
- Clean backup available at `STABLE-14-02-2026-1315/`

## Next Steps
- Monitor kanban workflow stability
- Continue daily AUTO_PUSH routine

## Git Commits
- `8231509` - Clean STABLE backup without nested Backups folder
