# Session Summary - 15-02-2026 (Evening)

**Date:** 15-02-2026  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes  
**Focus:** Debug "Context overflow" error happening after just 5 minutes of chat  
**Outcome:** Root cause identified, fix applied, pending verification

---

## Key Accomplishments

### ✅ Completed
- Identified root cause: telegram-to-flow forwarding system generating massive thinking blocks
- Disabled telegram-to-flow hook in `openclaw.json` (was firing on every Telegram message)
- Disabled telegram-to-flow-forward cron job (was running every 30 seconds)
- Restarted gateway to apply config changes
- Archived old bloated sessions (1,100-1,500 thinking blocks each)

### ⚠️ Issues Encountered
- **Context overflow error** — User hitting 262k token limit after just 5 minutes of chat
  - Root cause: Hook + cron creating isolated sessions with thousands of thinking blocks
  - Each session accumulated 80% thinking content from tool calls
  - System was processing forwarding logic constantly in background

### 🚫 Blocked/Deferred
- FLOW telegram auto-forwarding — Disabled until we redesign with batching approach

---

## Technical Decisions

1. **Disable hook entirely** — Hook was firing on every message, creating agent actions that accumulated thinking blocks
2. **Disable 30-second cron** — Too aggressive, created constant background processing
3. **Test before re-enabling** — Need to verify fix works before designing v2 of forwarding system

---

## Current State

- **Status:** Fix applied, awaiting user test with `/new`
- **Config:** Hook disabled, cron disabled, gateway restarted
- **Observation:** Old sessions had 1,100-1,500 thinking blocks each from today's forwarding activity

---

## Next Steps

1. **User does `/new`** to start fresh session
2. **Chat normally for 5-10 minutes** — verify no overflow error
3. **If fixed:** Design new batch-based forwarding (not real-time)
4. **If still broken:** Investigate Kimi K2.5 model issue or OpenClaw context leak

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Thinking blocks accumulate silently** — Even with thinking mode hidden, they eat 80% of context
- **30-second cron + per-message hook = death by a thousand cuts** — Background jobs need to be much less frequent
- **Monitor session transcript sizes** — 150KB+ files with mostly thinking content = red flag

*Session ended at 22:47. Ready for user to test `/new`.*
