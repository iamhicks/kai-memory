## Blockers

### FLOW Bugs (NEED FIXING)
1. **WebSocket occasional disconnects** - needs reconnection logic
2. **Rate limiting** - Kimi API limits hit during testing
3. **Mobile layout** - not optimized for small screens
4. **Context overflow** - large conversations may hit limits

### MIND Status
- Voice features working but need real-world testing
- ClawVault integration functional
- Ready for testing when FLOW is stable

## Current State

**FLOW:** Feature-complete but needs bug fixes and polish
**MIND:** Feature-complete, ready for integration testing
**MIND Pro:** Spec'd and shelved until FLOW is stable

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **FIX FLOW BUGS**
   - WebSocket stability
   - Rate limit handling
   - Mobile responsive layout
   - Context management

2. **TEST FLOW END-TO-END**
   - Telegram → FLOW flow
   - All role channels
   - Memory persistence
   - Git sync

3. **POLISH FLOW UI**
   - Consistent styling
   - Better error messages
   - Loading states
   - Empty states

4. **THEN: Extract modules for MIND Pro**
   - Stable kanban module
   - Stable chat module
   - Stable ClawVault integration

## Reflection

**What worked:**
- Telegram → FLOW integration is solid
- Modular architecture makes porting possible
- Git backups prevented data loss

**What didn't:**
- Rate limits during rapid testing
- WebSocket needs better error handling
- Should have focused on FLOW bugs before starting MIND Pro

**Decision:** FINISH FLOW FIRST. MIND Pro can wait for stable, battle-tested modules.
