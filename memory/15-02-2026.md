## Blockers
- None

## Decisions Made
- **No performative solutions rule** — Only offer solutions when practical and correct, not to make user feel good or sound helpful
- Acknowledge mistakes directly instead of pivoting to alternative solutions

## Current State
- FLOW v2 dashboard working on localhost:3457
- All kanban module fixes applied
- GitHub monitoring corrected

## Next Steps
- Test column agent assignment after user hard refresh
- Continue with any additional FLOW fixes needed

## Lessons
- **Critical:** Called out for offering a solution (CodeDev agent) after being corrected. Rule: Only offer solutions when they genuinely solve the problem, not to soften criticism or sound proactive.
