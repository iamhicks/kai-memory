## Accomplishments
- **FLOW Dashboard v2.0**: Major UI/UX overhaul with unified AI chat and ClawVault memory
- **Unified Chat System**: Replaced multi-agent approach with single Kai + contextual channels (General, Code, Design, Strategy, Debug)
- **ClawVault Memory Module**: Implemented structured, typed memory system with wiki-links and knowledge graph
- **Agent API Key System**: Added per-agent API keys with provider selection (Kimi, OpenAI, Ollama)
- **File Upload**: Implemented actual file upload with thumbnails and server storage
- **Column Agent Assignment**: Fixed bug where agents disappeared after assignment
- **Usage Tracking**: Added token/cost estimation per agent in chat details panel
- **Kanban Enhancements**: Due date formatting, recurring icons, human assignment option
- **GitHub Monitor**: Fixed to check i_am_Hicks repos instead of hellokaibot-alt

## Key Decisions
1. **One Agent > Multi-Agent**: Switched from separate agents to unified Kai with contextual channels (based on ClawVault/Claw Control philosophy)
2. **ClawVault Architecture**: Adopted structured memory with typed entries (decisions, lessons, preferences) and wiki-link connections
3. **Hybrid AI**: Support global + per-agent API keys, with Ollama as free local option
4. **Offline-First**: File uploads stored locally, SQLite database, no cloud dependency

## Blockers
- None

## Current State
- Server running on localhost:3457
- All modules loading correctly
- Chat system using unified agent approach
- Memory module with ClawVault structure deployed

## Next Steps
- Test unified chat with different channels
- Populate ClawVault with real project memories
- Consider migrating from mock AI responses to live API

## Lessons
- **Critical**: The ClawVault approach (one powerful agent + structured memory) is superior to multi-agent silos
- Multi-agent setups create artificial boundaries; unified agent with context switching is more natural
- Typed memory (decisions/lessons/preferences) makes retrieval far more effective than raw logs

## Technical Notes
- Cache busting essential: using ?v=29 for all assets
- Database migrations handled automatically (api_key, provider columns added)
- File uploads served from /uploads/ directory
- Navigation tabs now scroll horizontally to accommodate many modules
