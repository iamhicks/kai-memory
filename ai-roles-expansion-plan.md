1. ✅ **General** - Fully expanded with frameworks
2. ✅ **Code** - Fully expanded with technical decision trees  
3. ✅ **Design** - Fully expanded with conversion frameworks
4. ✅ **Strategy** - Fully expanded with strategic frameworks

13. ⏳ **Operations** - Need to expand
14. ⏳ **Mindset** - Need to expand
15. ✅ **Entrepreneur** - Already expanded (reference quality)

### Target Quality
Each role should match the **Entrepreneur role** depth:
- Detailed BACKGROUND with credentials
- 8-10 CORE EXPERTISE areas
- 5-6 step YOUR APPROACH methodology
- 8-10 CORE PRINCIPLES
- 3-4 specific FRAMEWORKS
- 6-8 QUESTIONS YOU ALWAYS ASK
- Detailed OUTPUT FORMAT
- TONE guidance

### Estimated Time
- 30-45 minutes per role
- 6-8 hours total for all 11 remaining

### Files to Update
1. `mind-dev/app/js/ai-roles-complete.js` - Source of truth
2. `mind-dev/app/index.html` - Embedded roles (if different)
3. Obsidian: `Kai/Business/Synapse/AI Roles.md` - Documentation

### Recommendation
Given the scope, I suggest:
1. **Priority 5 roles** (General, Strategy, Code, Marketing, Entrepreneur) - Use immediately
2. **Remaining 10** - Expand over next 2-3 sessions

OR

I can spawn a sub-agent to handle the expansion in parallel while we continue other work.

What's your preference?
