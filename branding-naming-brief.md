# Brand Naming Brief: I am Hicks
**Date:** February 2026  
**Prepared for:** Naming Agency / Branding Partner  
**Contact:** Pete Roberts, Founder

---

## Executive Summary

We're seeking a new company/brand name to match our pivoted focus. We've moved from a suite of productivity tools to a **single, focused product**: an AI-powered personal advisory board for solo founders.

**The old name** ("I am Hicks" / "Hicks") doesn't communicate our new positioning. We need a name that captures:
- **Personal guidance** (not just AI, but trusted advice)
- **Solo founder journey** (building alone, but not really alone)
- **Expertise on demand** (advisory board, not chatbot)
- **Privacy-first** (your data, your device, your control)

---

## The Product: What We Actually Do

### One-Sentence Description
**"A personal advisory board in your pocket — 15 AI advisors who understand the solo founder journey, available 24/7 for $19/month."**

### The Problem We Solve
Solo founders face a brutal reality:
- Every major decision falls on them
- No one to bounce ideas off at 3 AM when doubt strikes
- Traditional advisory boards cost $50K-$500K/year or 0.5%-2% equity
- Accelerators take 7% of the company
- Consultants charge $300+/hour

**The loneliness of solo building is real, and it affects decisions.**

9. **Research** — Market validation, competitive intel
10. **Writing** — Founder storytelling, copy
11. **Legal** — Contracts, risk protection
12. **Finance** — Runway, unit economics
13. **Operations** — Automation, processes
14. **Mindset** — Psychology, resilience
15. **Entrepreneur** — AI strategy, business models

**Unique Features:**

## Brand Positioning

### We Are NOT
- ❌ A chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude)
- ❌ A note-taking app (Notion, Obsidian)
- ❌ A task manager (Todoist, Things)
- ❌ A "suite of tools"
- ❌ Corporate / enterprise software
- ❌ A productivity app

### We ARE
- ✅ A **personal advisory board**
- ✅ For **solo founders** specifically
- ✅ **Expert guidance** (not generic AI)
- ✅ **Private** (data never leaves device)
- ✅ **Affordable** (1/1000th cost of real advisors)
- ✅ **Founder psychology-aware** (understands the emotional journey)

### Brand Personality
- **Empathetic** — We get the struggle
- **Direct** — No corporate BS, no fluff
- **Encouraging but honest** — Will tell you when you're wrong
- **Founder-first** — Built by someone who's been there
- **Privacy-obsessed** — Your data is sacred
- **Efficient** — Respects your time

### Tone of Voice
- Warm but sharp

- No buzzwords (synergy, leverage, holistic)
- Like a smart friend who's been through it
- Helpful without being condescending

**Example:**
- ❌ "We're thrilled to announce our innovative AI-powered advisory solution..."

## The Founder Story (Authenticity Hook)

**Pete Roberts** — Wales, UK
- 5 years learning to trade, transitioning to full-time
- Past: Web dev, UI/UX design, failed SaaS startups
- Family: Wife, 4-year-old daughter (top priority)
- Passion: Surfing/windsurfing (30 years)
- Struggle: Not earning yet, financial stress causing fear of loss
- Need: Overcome psychology (loss aversion, FOMO), build discipline

### Why This Product Exists
> "I built this because I needed it. Trading alone at 3 AM, no one to call when I wasn't sure whether to hold or cut. Building alone, no one to bounce ideas off. I wanted an advisory board but couldn't afford $50K/year or give away equity. So I built one that fits a solo founder's budget."

**The authenticity:** This isn't a VC-backed startup solving a hypothetical problem. This is a founder solving his own problem, for other founders like him.

## Naming Criteria

### MUST Have
1. **Available .com** (or strong alternative like .co, .io)
2. **Easy to spell** when heard
3. **Easy to pronounce** when read
4. **Memorable** — sticks in mind
5. **Short** — 1-2 words ideally
6. **Passes the "bar test"** — sounds natural when saying "I use [Name]"

### SHOULD Have
- Evokes **advice, guidance, wisdom, council**
- OR evokes **founder journey, building, solo entrepreneurship**
- OR is **abstract but evocative** (like "Notion" or "Figma")
- **No negative connotations** in major languages
- **Trademark available** (or low risk)

### SHOULD NOT Have
- ❌ Too techy/acronym-y (IBM, SAP — too corporate)
- ❌ Too cutesy (Bubbles, Snuggles — not serious enough)
- ❌ Hard to spell (Flickr, Tumblr — friction)
- ❌ Too narrow (NotePad, TaskMaster — implies limited scope)
- ❌ Already used by major brand
- ❌ Sounds like a feature, not a product

## Name Types We Like

### Type 1: Advisory/Mentorship Evocative
**Concept:** Directly communicates guidance
- **Examples:** Counsel, Mentor, Sage, Advisor, Board
- **Good for:** Clarity, immediate understanding
- **Risk:** May sound corporate/dry

### Type 2: Founder Journey Metaphor
**Concept:** Captures the solo founder experience
- **Examples:** Solo, Path, Journey, Compass, North
- **Good for:** Emotional resonance
- **Risk:** May be too abstract

### Type 3: Abstract/Evocative
**Concept:** Short, memorable, creates meaning over time
- **Examples:** Notion, Figma, Linear, Raycast
- **Good for:** Strong brand potential, differentiation
- **Risk:** Requires more marketing to establish meaning

### Type 4: Compound Words
**Concept:** Two words that create meaning together
- **Examples:** AdvisoryBoard (too literal?), SoloSage, FounderMind
- **Good for:** Clarity + memorability
- **Risk:** Can be clunky if not careful

## Names We've Considered (and why they didn't work)

| Name | Why It Didn't Work |
|------|-------------------|
| Hicks | Too personal (founder's name), doesn't communicate product |
| I am Hicks | Confusing, sounds like social media, not advisory |
| Synapse | Too techy, sounds like a dev tool |
| Cortex | Too medical/brain-focused, not advisory |
| Flow | Too generic, already used by many products |
| MIND | Too generic, sounds like meditation/mental health |

---

## Domain Strategy

### Preferred
- **.com** — Still the gold standard
- **.co** — Acceptable for modern startups
- **.io** — Tech-focused, acceptable

### Avoid
- **.ai** — Overused, sounds cheap now
- **.app** — Harder to remember
- Hyphenated domains (e.g., my-advisor.com)

## Deliverables from Agency

### Phase 1: Discovery & Concept
1. **Name exploration** — 20-30 name concepts with rationale
2. **Availability check** — Domain + trademark preliminary check
3. **Linguistic check** — No negative meanings in major languages

### Phase 2: Refinement
1. **Shortlist** — Top 5 names with detailed rationale
2. **Visual concepts** — Basic logo/wordmark exploration for top 3
3. **Final recommendation** — Top choice with alternatives

## Key Questions for Agency

1. **Does the name communicate "advisory/guidance" or is it better to be abstract?**
   (We're torn between clarity vs. strong brand potential)

2. **Should we consider founder's personal brand?**
   (Pete has some recognition in trading community — leverage or separate?)

3. **Is "Hicks" salvageable with a modifier?**
   (Hicks Advisory, Hicks Board, etc. — or start fresh?)

4. **What emotion should the name evoke?**
   - Trust/security? (Sage, Counsel)
   - Journey/adventure? (Path, Compass)
   - Intelligence/expertise? (Cortex, Synapse — though we rejected these)
   - Community/support? (Solo → implies alone, but we solve that)

5. **Target market nuance:**
   - Should it appeal more to technical founders or business founders?
   - US-heavy market — any UK-specific considerations?

## Final Thoughts

We're not just naming a product. We're naming a **new category**: the personal advisory board for solo founders. The name should feel like it could become the default way people describe this type of product (like "Google it" or "Slack me").

The name needs to work for:
- A bootstrapped solo founder today
- A funded startup with 10 employees in 2 years
- Potentially expanding beyond founders (consultants, creators, indie hackers)

**Most importantly:** The name should feel authentic to who we are — a founder building for other founders, respecting their journey, their privacy, and their need for guidance without giving up control.

*Looking forward to your concepts and questions.*
