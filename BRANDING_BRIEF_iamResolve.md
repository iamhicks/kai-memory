# BRANDING BRIEF: i_am_Resolve Product Suite

**Prepared for:** [Branding Agency]  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Contact:** Pete Roberts, Founder

## 1. WHAT WE ARE

A unified productivity platform that combines **notes**, **tasks**, and **AI assistance** into one seamless experience. Think: Notion + Obsidian + AI assistant, but completely private and offline-first.

**Core Products:**
- **MIND** — AI-powered notes with wiki-links and knowledge graphs
- **FLOW** — Kanban task management
- **AI Agent (Kai)** — Context-aware assistant that learns your work (Automated tier only)

---

## 2. TWO-TIER STRUCTURE (CRITICAL FOR BRANDING)

We offer **two versions** of the same product:

### Tier 1: Manual (Self-Directed)
- **Price:** $49 one-time purchase
- **Experience:** User drives everything. Local AI (bring your own API). No external services.
- **Tagline idea:** "Your tools, your control"

### Tier 2: Automated (AI-Augmented)  
- **Price:** $99 + subscription
- **Experience:** AI agent (Kai) proactively helps, monitors, suggests. Connected to Telegram/Discord for voice commands.
- **Tagline idea:** "Your partner in getting things done"

**The names should work for BOTH tiers** — one brand, two experience levels.

## 3. TARGET AUDIENCES (8 NICHE TEMPLATES)

Our product adapts to different user types via templates:

1. **Traders** — Journal trades, track setups, manage psychology
2. **Content Creators** — Script pipeline, publishing workflow
3. **Students/Researchers** — Courses, assignments, flashcards
4. **Consultants/Coaches** — Client management, session notes
5. **Writers** — Manuscript workflow, character sheets
6. **Project Managers** — Tasks, decisions, team coordination
7. **Therapists** — Private practice notes (HIPAA-conscious)
8. **General Knowledge Workers** — Personal wiki, second brain

**Primary Audience:** Solo professionals and creators aged 25-45 who value privacy, ownership of their data, and thoughtful design.

## 4. KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

**vs. Notion:** We work offline, no subscription required for core product, AI is local/private
**vs. Obsidian:** We have integrated task management (Kanban) and optional AI agent
**vs. ChatGPT/Claude:** We have persistent memory of YOUR notes and context
**vs. Roam/Logseq:** We have better UI/UX and actual task management

**Unique Selling Points:**
- ✅ 100% offline — your data never leaves your device (Manual tier)
- ✅ One AI across all your work — notes, tasks, conversations
- ✅ Templates for specific niches — not one-size-fits-all
- ✅ Upgrade path — start simple, add AI agent when ready
- ✅ Beautiful, minimal UI — focused on deep work

## 5. BRAND PERSONALITY

**We are:**
- **Thoughtful** — every feature has purpose, no bloat
- **Private** — your thoughts are yours alone
- **Capable** — powerful enough for professionals, simple enough for everyone
- **Focused** — helps you resolve ideas into outcomes
- **Human** — warm, not corporate; intelligent, not robotic

**We are NOT:**
- ❌ Corporate/enterprise-y
- ❌ Hyper-productivity bro culture
- ❌ Complicated or feature-bloated
- ❌ Cloud-dependent or surveillance-capitalist

**Tone:** Calm, confident, intentional. Like a trusted mentor or skilled assistant.

## 6. NAMING PREFERENCES

**Current working name:** i_am_Resolve  
**Current tech term:** ClawVault (needs to change — means nothing to users)

**What we like:**
- **Short** — 1-2 words ideally
- **Meaningful** — suggests completion, clarity, knowledge, memory, or resolution
- **Versatile** — works for both Manual and Automated tiers
- **Available** — .com or strong alternative available
- **Global** — no negative connotations in other languages
- **Timeless** — not trendy, will age well

**Concepts to explore:**
- Resolution/resolve/completion
- Memory/knowledge/mind/brain
- Clarity/focus/flow
- Vault/archive/safe keeping
- Personal/self/identity

**Avoid:**
- Tech jargon ("sync," "cloud," "data")
- Overused words ("task," "note," "productivity")
- Made-up words that require explanation
- Anything too similar to Notion, Obsidian, Roam, or other competitors

---

## 7. VISUAL DIRECTION (INITIAL THOUGHTS)

**Color palette:** Neutral base (cream/white/soft gray) with one warm accent (amber/orange/gold)
**Typography:** Serif headings (elegant, human) + Sans-serif body (clean, modern)
**Vibe:** Clean, spacious, calm. Not cluttered. Think: Aesop, Notion, or high-end notebook brand.
**Metaphors:** Library, study, workshop, garden (growing knowledge), workshop (crafting ideas)

---

## 8. DELIVERABLES NEEDED

1. **Product Name** — Replaces "i_am_Resolve" (should work for both tiers)
2. **Feature Name** — Replaces "ClawVault" (the backup/memory system)
3. **Tier Names** — Better descriptors than "Manual" and "Automated"
4. **Logo concept** — Mark + wordmark
5. **Color palette** — Primary, secondary, accent
6. **Typography system** — Heading and body fonts

---

## 9. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

**Direct competitors:**
- Notion — collaborative workspace
- Obsidian — networked notes
- Roam Research — networked thought
- Logseq — open-source alternative to Roam
- Capacities — object-based notes

**Adjacent:**
- Todoist/Things — task management
- Evernote — legacy notes
- Apple Notes/Google Keep — simple capture

**Differentiation:** We bridge notes + tasks + AI in one private, offline-first app with niche-specific templates.

---

**Presentation:** 3-5 name options with rationale, logo sketches, and visual direction
